# ElectricityLogger
An Android app to enable you to calculate the carbon footprint of your home electricity usage

# Install
Recommended installation method for development is to clone this repository and import the project into Android Studio.

# HOW TO USE
1. Download the code and build an apk for your Android device.
2. Find your latest utility bill either online or posted to you
3. Start the app. 
4. The app will ask if you are in the UK. If you are not in the UK, see the next step. If you are in the UK you should have a QR code on your electricity provider bill (by law), and you will be prompted to scan this in the next step. The QR code may contain the following information amongst others: your energy provider(s), your postcode, your estimated annual electricity usage, your estimated annual gas usage, date and time stamps. The app does not record or share any of this information online.
5. If you are not in the UK, click No. You will be prompted to enter your country and energy supplier (so as to get carbon intensity of the electricity you use), and your estimated annual energy usage.
6. After scanning or manually inputting your electricity usage data you will be given a summary of the carbon footprint of your domestic electricity usage. Don't forget that this is not the only electricity you use! Electricity used for refrigerating food in shops, cafes and in warehouses before you buy it is not included, nor the multitude of other aspects of life which involve electricity usage. Notably, the electricity used to power servers to serve internet web pages, like this one, are not included.. 

# PRIVACY
